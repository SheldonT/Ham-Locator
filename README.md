<h1>Ham Locator</h1>

Ham Locator is very simple ham radio logging application. To add a contact to your log, just fill out the contact information fields and press enter, or click/tap the submit button. The contact information is entered into a table in reverse order, and saved in your browsers local storage, so your log won't clear if the browser is closed or refreshed. The location of each station in your log will be plotted on a world map. Clicking on any map marker or a row in the table will refocus the map onto that station's location and display some extra information, such as the station's time zone and country flag. Optional data fields, such as contact name, grid location, or serial numbers for contesting, can be added to the input bar from the settings menu.

Go <a href="https://sheldont.github.io/Ham-Locator/">here</a> to try Ham Locator. If you're not a radio amateur, enter "DEMO" into the Callsign field when prompted to enter yoru home information. For testing, you can also find some example ham radio callsigns and log entries from my qrz.com page <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/VO1TWR">here</a>, under the Logbook tab. Any issues can be submitted under the Issues tab above.
