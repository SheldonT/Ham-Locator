<h1>Ham Locator</h1>

Ham Locator is an app for displaying the location of a ham radio station based on the station's callsign. After a callsign is entered, the station's location is plotted and focused on a world map. The station's information is also entered into a table, and hovering the mouse cursor over a table entry will refocus the map to the location of that particular station.

Go to https://sheldont.github.io/Ham-Locator/ to try Ham Locator. You can find some ham radio callsigns from my qrz.com profile at https://www.qrz.com/db/VO1TWR, under the Logbook tab. This project is intended to be part of a ham radio logging application, which will hopefully be a future project.
