<h1>Ham Locator</h1>

Ham Locator is a simple, web based, ham radio logging application. Submitted contact information is displayed in a table, and the map focuses on the contacts location, baed on their callsign. Clicking on any row in the table, or a map marker, will refocus the map to that station. Log statistics, such as number of contacts per band and per country, is graphically displayed on the stats page. The log is automatically stored in the browser local storage, and can be downloaded in either ADIF or CSV formats.

Go <a href="https://sheldont.github.io/Ham-Locator/">here</a> to try Ham Locator. If you're not a radio amateur, you can find some ham radio callsigns and log entries from my qrz.com log <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/VO1TWR">here</a>, under the Logbook tab. This project is intended to be part of a larger ham radio logging application, which will hopefully be a future project.
