<h1>Ham Locator</h1>

Ham Locator is a simple, web based, ham radio logging application. After a contact's information is entered, the station's location is plotted and focused on a world map, and the station's information is displayed in a table. Clicking on any row in the table, or a map marker, will refocus the map to that station. Lot statistics, such as number of contacts per band and per country, can be viewed on the stats page. The log is automatically stored in the browser local storage, and can be downloaded in either ADIF or CSV formats.

Go to https://sheldont.github.io/Ham-Locator/ to try Ham Locator. You can find some ham radio callsigns from my qrz.com profile at https://www.qrz.com/db/VO1TWR, under the Logbook tab. This project is intended to be part of a ham radio logging application, which will hopefully be a future project.
